I wanted it clean, extensible, and scalable.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nOnly a few prerequisites to use this plugin (a prereq's prereqs listed as well).\r\n\r\n* AngularJS\r\n* Angular-UI Bootstrap\r\n    * Bootstrap\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n##### Node\r\n\r\n```npn install ng-alerts --save```\r\n\r\n##### Bower\r\n\r\n```bower install ng-alerts --save```\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nng-alerts is made to be flexible for the benefit of the developer. Mix and match whatever systems you want to achieve whatever you would like!.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see a quick example, just open */test/index.html* and that will let you know what to expect, otherwise read the information below.\r\n\r\nFirst, you must include the module name in your dependencies list.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar testApp = angular.module('testApp', [\r\n    'ngAlerts'\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nng-alerts will now be installed for you to use throughout your application. It is recommended you interface through **ngAlertsMngr** to add your alerts.\r\n```javascript\r\ntestApp.controller('TestCtrl', function ($scope, ngAlertsMngr) {\r\n    $scope.createAlert = function () {\r\n        ngAlertsMngr.add('testing');\r\n    };\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the **add** function will add a notification and update all directives throughout your application.\r\n\r\n### Directives\r\n\r\n##### ng-alerts-count\r\n\r\nUse this to display the current count of notifications.\r\n\r\n* **badge** - Set this attribute to \"true\" if you want it to take on the appearance of a bade.\r\n* **hide-empty** - Set this to \"true\" if you want to completely remove the text if you have \"zero\" alerts.\r\n\r\n##### ng-alerts-list\r\n\r\nDisplays a list of alerts, with the ability to remove them.\r\n\r\n##### ng-alerts-popover\r\n\r\nCreates an anchor for displaying ```ng-alerts-list``` in a popover.\r\n\r\n* **position** - Set this attribute to define where you want the popover to draw. Accepted values are 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right'. Defaults to 'top'.\r\n\r\n### Can I contribute?\r\n\r\nYES! Pull requests welcome!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
